# TowerDefenceGame

Tower Defense - the name of the genre of computer strategic games. The task of the player in games of this genre is to deal with the advancing enemies, called in some "creeps" games, before they cross the map, by building towers that attack them when they pass near. Opponents and towers usually differ in their characteristics and damage.
In the game, the user must place on the map monsters (towers), which would provide him with a win.

Each monster has its own type of damage. Monster, as one of the main classes of this project has three types:
  - A monster with fire damage;
  - a monster with an icy laser;
  - A monster with a fire damage and the possibility of critical damage.
  
The monster with the fire damage has the advantage over the red beetles and inflicts weak damage to the blue beetles, the monster with the icy laser inflicts weak damage to the red beetles and significant damage to the blue beetles, the monster with the possibility of critical damage inflicts significant damage to all types of beetles.

The whole gameplay is based on the fact that the user buys monsters to build protection. And he wins when he reflects all the attacks of beetles, that is, will not allow bugs to reach the biscuit.
